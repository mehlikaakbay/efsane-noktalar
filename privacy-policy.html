This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled when you use our App. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect or Store</h2>
<p>
We do not collect or store any personal data ourselves. Some data (such as location coordinates) may be processed by third-party services strictly to provide app functionality.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Display nearby döner restaurant locations</li>
  <li>Calculate distances between your location and restaurants</li>
  <li>Center the map view on your current position</li>

    Location data is processed on your device and used only to display maps and nearby locations through Google Maps SDK.
    We do not collect or store this data.
  </li>
  <li>Location is not used for tracking, profiling, or advertising</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your control:</strong></p>
<p>
You can disable location access at any time through your device settings. The App will continue to function, but you will need to manually search for locations or browse the map.

Google Maps may process location data according to their own privacy practices. We do not receive, collect, or store any data from Google Maps.

</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

Efsane Noktalar is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction).

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
If you believe a child has provided information through the App, please contact us immediately so we can address the situation.
